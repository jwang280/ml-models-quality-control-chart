# Quality Control Chart

There are some unignorable issues with learned models in a production situation after a period of time such as:

Hardware / Software issues - especially memory leaks and server upgrades Model decay Data Drift - changes in data collection methodology Concept Drift - the way we think about the modelâ€™s goal can evolve.

This Quality Control Chart is to make sure that the model prediction process predictable and within limits only with random variation or noise.

Quality Control Chart can give us a warning if non-random variation or signal presented, which is not normally present in the system and makes the process unpredictable.
